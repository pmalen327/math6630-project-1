To reproduce the figure, simply run `p1.py` with no additional arguments.  

The `report.tex` SHOULD compile just fine but if there are any issues, there is
a pre-compiled report `6630_Project_1.pdf`.  

The produced figure is also attached as I think `report.tex` has to pull it from
a shared directory.  

If there are any issues viewing or reproducing results, please let me know and I
can provide additional documents if needed. I did the report in Overleaf so if there
are compliation issues, that is most likely why.
